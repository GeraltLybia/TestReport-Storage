# Allure Reports Storage

Web application for storing and viewing Allure test reports.

## Project Structure
- `frontend` - Vue 3 application (UI for report management and viewer)
- `backend` - FastAPI service (upload/download/list/delete reports, history management)
- `storage` - runtime directory for report files and `history.jsonl`, ignored by git
- `docker-compose.yml` - production-like container orchestration

## Backend Structure
The internal backend code for reports and history now lives in the `app/services/reporting` package.

The logic is split by responsibility:
- `app/services/reporting/reports.py` - report service
- `app/services/reporting/history.py` - `history.jsonl` service
- `app/services/reporting/history_index.py` - build/update logic for `history_index.json`
- `app/services/reporting/analytics.py` - dashboard aggregates
- `app/services/reporting/repositories/` - file-based repositories
- `app/services/reporting/models.py` - internal typed models

This is intentional so the code package is not confused with the runtime `storage/` directory.

## API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
When backend is running:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`

In Docker deployment (through frontend proxy):
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8080/redoc`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8080/openapi.json`

## Run with Docker (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/zaharpirozenko/Documents/allure3_folder
docker compose up --build
```

Endpoints:
- App UI: `http://localhost:8080`
- Backend (internal): `backend:8000`

Stop:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Local Development Run
### Backend
```bash
cd /Users/zaharpirozenko/Documents/allure3_folder/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/zaharpirozenko/Documents/allure3_folder/frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Frontend dev server: `http://localhost:5173`

## Main Features
- Dedicated Dashboard page for QA analytics based on run history
- Upload Allure report archives (`.zip`)
- Browse stored reports
- Preview reports directly in iframe viewer
- Download and delete reports
- Upload/download `history.jsonl`
- History-based metrics from `history.jsonl`: pass rate, unstable/flaky tests, failure signatures, tag health, trends
- Dashboard filters by `tag`, `suite`, `environment`, and `failure signature`
- Deep-linkable Dashboard filters via URL query parameters
- Automatic report retention by limit (default 10 latest reports)
- Healthcheck endpoint: `GET /health`

## History API
- `GET /api/history` - download the current `history.jsonl`
- `POST /api/history` - upload a new `history.jsonl`
- `GET /api/history/info` - get `history.jsonl` metadata
- `GET /api/history/dashboard` - get dashboard aggregates without downloading the whole file
- `GET /api/history/dashboard/tests/{test_key}` - get selected test details for the dashboard
- `POST /api/history/rebuild-index` - force a full reread of `history.jsonl` and rebuild `history_index.json`

## Dashboard
Dashboard is available at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard` in Docker deployment
or `http://localhost:5173/dashboard` in frontend dev mode.

What the Dashboard shows:
- History KPIs: runs, unique tests, pass rate, p95 duration
- Stability block: flaky tests, always failed, always passed, incidents
- Recent runs trend for `passed / failed / broken`
- Most unstable tests
- Top failure signatures
- Tag health
- Quick navigation to recent and problematic reports

How the data is used:
- Report summary widgets are built from extracted Allure reports
- QA metrics and trends are built from the aggregated index `storage/history_index.json`
- `history_index.json` is created lazily on the first `history.jsonl` processing and is not required at service startup
- When a new `history.jsonl` is uploaded and it only appends data at the end, the backend usually reads only the new tail and updates the index incrementally
- If the index is missing, corrupted, or suspected to be out of sync, call `POST /api/history/rebuild-index` to force a full rebuild from the current `history.jsonl`
- If `history.jsonl` is missing, history-based widgets remain empty-state

Interactivity:
- Clicking Stability cards opens a popup with matching test names
- From the Stability popup, you can select a test and open the `Test Details` panel
- Clicking tag health and failure signatures applies the corresponding filter

## Configuration
Backend environment variables:
- `APP_STORAGE_ROOT` - storage directory path (default: `storage`)
- `APP_MAX_REPORTS` - maximum number of stored reports (default: `10`)

Retention behavior:
- After uploading a new report, if the total count exceeds `APP_MAX_REPORTS`,
  the oldest report directories are removed automatically.
